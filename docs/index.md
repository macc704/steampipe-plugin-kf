# Hypothesis + Steampipe

[Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is) is a web annnotation system.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

List annotations on `www.example.com`, with at least one tag, by a user other than `judell`:

```sql
  select 
    "user",
    tags
  from 
    hypothesis_search 
  where 
    query = 'uri=https://www.example.com'
  and jsonb_array_length(tags) > 0
  and "user" !~ 'judell'
```

```shell
   user   |                             tags

## Documentation

- **[Table definitions & examples â†’](/plugins/turbot/hypothesis/tables)**

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Hypothesis plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install twilio
```

### Credentials

| Item | Description |
| - | - |
| Credentials | Get your API token from the [Hypothesis service](https://hypothes.is/account/developer). The token is optional. Without it, you can still query the Hypothesis public layer. 

### Configuration

Installing the latest twilio plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/hypothesis.spc`) with a single connection named `hypothesis`:

If you are a Hypothesis user wanting to query your own private notes, or notes in private groups you belong to, then uncomment `#token` and provide your API token.

  ```hcl
  connection "hypothesis" {
    plugin  = "hypothesis"
    #token   = "6879-35....3df5"
  }
```
